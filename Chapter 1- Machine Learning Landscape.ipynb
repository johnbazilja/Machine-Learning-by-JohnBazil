    "In short, since your main task is to select a model and train it on some data, the two things that can go wrong are \"bad model\" and \"bad data\", Let's start with examples of bad data.\n",
    "### Bad Data\n",
    "1. Insuffiient Quantity of data\n",
    "2. Non - representative training data (sampling bias)\n",
    "3. Poor quality data (full of errors, outliers and noise\n",
    "4. Irrelevant features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bad Algorithm\n",
    "1. Overfitting the training data \n",
    "\n",
    "Ways to reduce: By reducing the number of attributes in the training data or by constraining the model(Regularization), Gather more training data, Reduce the noise in the training data.. Hyper Parameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Underfitting the training data\n",
    "\n",
    "Ways to reduce: Select more powerful model with more parameters, feed better features, reduce the  regularization hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practice:\n",
    "1. Testing and Validation: Generalization error\n",
    "2. Hyperparamter Tuning and model selection\n",
    "3. Divide the dataset into 3: Train set, validation set and test set and do cross validation\n",
    "4. Take assumptions for the data.\n",

    "      ######             One option is to train 100 different models using 100 different values for this hyperparameter. Suppose you find the best hyperparame ter value that produces a model with the lowest generalization error-say, just 5% error. You launch this model into production, but unfortunately it does not perform as well as expected and produces 15% errors. What just happened?\n",
    "      ######             The problem is that you measured the generalization error multiple times on the test set, and you adapted the model and hyperparameters to produce the best model for that particular set. This means the model is unlikely to perform as well on new data. A common solution to this problem is called holdout validation"
